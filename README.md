# ISPR-UNIPI-LDA-Image-Understanding
Implemented a simple image understanding application for [MSRC dataset v1](http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/1/1/A116CD80-5B79-407E-B5CE-3D5C6ED8B0D5/msrc_objcategimagedatabase_v1.zip) using the LDA model and the bag of visual terms approach. 
Performed different tests for:
- SIFT descriptors extracted from interest points identified by the SIFT detector
- SIFT descriptors extracted from MSER Keypoints
- Daisy descriptor extracted by a grid-like approach
