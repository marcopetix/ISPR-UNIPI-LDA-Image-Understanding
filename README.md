# ISPR-UNIPI-LDA-Image-Understanding
Implemented a simple image understanding application for DSET2 using the LDA model and the bag of visual terms approach. 
Performed different tests for:
- SIFT descriptors extracted from interest points identified by the SIFT detector
- SIFT descriptors extracted from MSER Keypoints
- Daisy descriptor extracted by a grid-like approach
